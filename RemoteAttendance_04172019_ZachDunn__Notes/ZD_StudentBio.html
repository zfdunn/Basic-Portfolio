                <p>King's College Alumni-Class of 2010. Criminal Justice major (very expensive piece of paper). I lived in East Falls prior to becoming a resident of West Deptford, NJ, where my better half and I have been happily living together for past 5 years.  It took her approx 5 months prior to guilting me into one of the best decisions in my life, adopting our first fur baby, "Obi-Wan".  Obi is 1/2 Great Dane, 1/2 Golden Retriever, but 100% good/sweet boy!  My wife and I officially tied the knot in late '17; and are expecting our first born this August!</p>
                <p>My most professional experience, has been working in SW Philadelphia an electronic-waste and recycling facility for past 7.  Started in operations; transistioned into leadership roles very quickly; Spent 4/7 years supervising ops, logistics, and consumer collection events for our client municipalities, prior to spending the next year transitioning into compliance.  I spent the next 2 years leading our Environmental, Health & Safety Compliance; Transportation Compliance, and Certifications Compliance (audits are fun!!! :-( !!). Last year year, I assumed this role in a larger capacity (regionally). I spend half of the month traveling to York, Lebanon, and Lancaster areas to oversee these programs for neighboring facilities; spend other half in SW Phila.</p>
                <p>Although I've come a long way, I have much left to travel (hopefully not back to central PA!), and I know investing time with this class (and I'm sure many more educational experiences to come) will solidify my family's future, as today's world continues to rapidly evolve into "less tangible things :-)".</p>
